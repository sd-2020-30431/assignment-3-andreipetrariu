This is a guide for setting up the 'Waste less 3' assignment.

1) Run the mysql script file 'wastelessdb_script' to import the database and values.

2) In Eclipse, go to File -> New -> Project. Go to Web and select 'Dynamic Web Project'.

3) Convert the project to a maven project (Right-click project folder -> Configure -> Convert to Maven Project.

4) Copy-Paste the src, WebContent folders and the pom.xml file in the project's folder and do a maven update(Right-click
project -> Maven -> Update Project, check 'Force Update of Snapshots/Releases" and ok. Make sure the src folder is in
the project source's build path. (Go to the project -> configure build path, in the Source tab.
(If the java files have errors, mouse over the error and set the java compliance to 1.8)

5) Add a server to the project and configure its default port as 8081.(or modify the HttpURLConnection objects in WLClient.java, from "http://localhost:8081" to your server's default port )

6) Run the project on server, then run Main.java from the client package as a java application.

 !If the login fails, set the 'status' value of the user you are loggin with(by default 'Andrei98) to 0.
 !In my version of Waste Less, the reports only keep records of the groceries that have been wasted (haven't 
been consumed until their expiration date). So, if you consume an item and it doesn't appear on the reports,
it's OK, this is how I decided to implement the reports.  If you want to test the reports you have to modify the values
in the database: set an item's consumption date after the expiration date, and when the application runs the item
should be written in the reports.
